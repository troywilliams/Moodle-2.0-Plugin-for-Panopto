Guide for upgrading from bespoke UoW version.

The upgrade code has been modified to allow a upgrade path from old UoW bespoke version to the standard Panopto distributed plugin.

Once upgrade to version 2017082900 is complete, any subsequent upgrades can use later plugin versions distributed by Panopto.
